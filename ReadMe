Data should never ever be hardcoded whatsoever !

Data should be centralized and fed to the code. This can be achieved via 3 ways:

	A- .properties class file.
	B- Parameterizing the data from the TestNg xml file:

		2- From a test folder (That is a shell/module) level where data is applicable to only these .java class files under such a test folder.
		3- From the method level utilizing @dataprovider anotation (When a set of data is fed to the same testcase/method to run it multiple times)
